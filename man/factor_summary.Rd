\title{Factor Analysis Summary Tool}

\description{
This function is designed to compile and present a summary of factor analysis results, including factor loadings, communalities, and uniquenesses for each item. It is ideal for quickly assessing the key outputs of a factor analysis, such as from the `psych` package. The function allows for a concise overview of how each item loads on the factors and their individual contributions to the model.
}

\usage{
factor_summary(factors_data, num_items, num_factors)
}

\arguments{
  \item{factors_data}{An object typically generated by a factor analysis function, containing loadings, communalities, and uniquenesses.}
  \item{num_items}{The number of items to include in the summary. This should correspond to the number of rows in the factor loading matrix.}
  \item{num_factors}{The number of factors to include in the summary. This should correspond to the number of columns in the factor loading matrix.}
}

\details{
The function extracts the first `num_items` rows and `num_factors` columns from the factor loading matrix in `factors_data`. It then appends communalities and uniquenesses for each item. The output is formatted into a tidy data frame for easy interpretation and analysis.
}

\value{
A data frame where each row represents an item and columns include factor loadings for each factor, communalities (`h2`), and uniquenesses (`u2`). The items are identified in the first column.
}

\examples{
# Assuming 'factors_data' is an object with factor analysis results
summary_data <- factor_summary(factors_data, num_items = 24, num_factors = 5)
print(summary_data)
