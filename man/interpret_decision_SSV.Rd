\title{Interpretation of Modification Indices and Power in Model Specification}

\description{
This function interprets the modification indices (MI) and power values from a structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis, providing recommendations on whether to modify model constraints based on statistical and substantive considerations.
}

\usage{
interpret_decision_SSV(MI_Saris)
}

\arguments{
\item{MI_Saris}{A dataframe containing the modification indices, power values, and other relevant details of the model parameters. The dataframe should include at least the columns \code{lhs}, \code{op}, \code{rhs}, and \code{decision.pow}.}
}

\details{
The function processes the \code{decision.pow} values, which indicate different scenarios based on MI significance, power, and expected parameter change (EPC). The interpretation follows these rules:

\code{"EPC:M"}: MI is significant, power is high, and EPC is sufficiently large; releasing the parameter is recommended.

\code{"EPC:NM"}: MI is significant and power is high, but EPC is small; modification is not substantively relevant, and the restriction is maintained.

\code{"M"}: MI is significant, but power is low; there is misspecification, but its magnitude is uncertain.

\code{"NM"}: No evidence of misspecification; either MI is not significant, or despite significance, high power suggests a small EPC. The restriction is maintained.

\code{"I"}: Insufficient information (low power) to make a clear decision on misspecification; the result is inconclusive.

Other values are flagged as unrecognized decisions.

The function returns a dataframe containing the original parameter constraints and their corresponding interpretations.
}

\value{
A dataframe with the original parameter relationships (\code{lhs}, \code{op}, \code{rhs}) and the interpreted decision based on MI, power, and EPC.
}

\examples{

Example dataframe with MI and power decisions

MI_Saris <- data.frame(
lhs = c("F1", "F2", "F3"),
op = c("", "", "~"),
rhs = c("X1", "X2", "X3"),
decision.pow = c("EPC:M", "M", "NM")
)

Running the interpretation function

interpret_results <- interpret_decision_SSV(MI_Saris)
print(interpret_results)
